# check-brand-lint.sh: Detect brand/style violations (em dashes, banned phrases,
# maintainer-vocabulary leaks) in published workshop content. Read-only.
# Adapted directly from object-lesson's and copilot-fluent's scripts/check-brand-lint.sh.
#
# Scope: published content only, per docs/brand.md's own boundary. Design/
# planning docs under docs/ (including docs/brand.md itself) are working
# documents and are explicitly exempt.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-brand-lint.sh           # human report
#   scripts/check-brand-lint.sh --check   # hook mode: exit 1 if violations found
#
# Network: none. Pure local file inspection.
